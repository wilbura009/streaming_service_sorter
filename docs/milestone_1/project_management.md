# Project Management Document for StreamEZ
 
## I. Definition of the tasks involved in the project

The goal of the project is to create a central hub to find and discover new content (tv, movies, etc.) and specifically where exactly you can find this content.. To achieve this we must develop a web scraper that can gather information from various streaming sites about the content they have. Next task is to catalog the data  and make it easily accessible and searchable to the user. The final aspect of the project is discovery, creating functionality where users can visit to find new content that is trending or highly rated.
 
## II. Risk

The risks to the end user are very minimal since this platform doesn’t necessarily connect with any other services. This means that the biggest risk to end users is the security of their password and login data.

The monetary risks to the development team is securing the funding necessary to catalog the data and maintain the portal. Since the data isn’t confidential but rather information about shows and movies streaming platforms have, the risk to data is standard but not as much of consequence.

## III. Evaluation criteria and methods

We plan to run a user study to evaluate usability.
 
## IV. Implementation

 
## V. Training

Support can be offered via a FAQ page detailing the most common problems.

## VI. Maintenance

 
## VII. Future needs

Future versions could include more social networking options that allow you to perhaps connect with other users and see their top recommendations or recent ratings. (Letterboxd would be perfect for this)
