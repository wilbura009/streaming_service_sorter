# Project Management Document for StreamEZ
 
## I. Definition of the tasks involved in the project

The goal of the project is to create a central hub to find and discover new content (tv, movies, etc.) and specifically where exactly you can find this content.. To achieve this we must develop a web scraper that can gather information from various streaming sites about the content they have. Next task is to catalog the data  and make it easily accessible and searchable to the user. The final aspect of the project is discovery, creating functionality where users can visit to find new content that is trending or highly rated.
 
## II. Risk

The risks to the end-user are very minimal since this platform doesn’t necessarily connect with any other services. This means that the biggest risk to end-users is the security of their password and login data.

The monetary risk to the development team is securing the funding necessary to catalog the data and maintain the portal. Since the data isn’t confidential but rather information about shows and movies streaming platforms have, the risk to data is standard but not as much of consequence.

## III. Evaluation criteria and methods

We plan to run a user study to evaluate usability.

## V. Training

Support can be offered via a FAQ link detailing the most common problems at the bottom of the front page. There will also be contact information for help at the bottom of the front page. We will also have a Contact Us link that users will be able to inquire about issues with the web app. Another thing we have implemented would be our community portal were forums will exist that can allow users to interact with each other about bugs so users don't have to go through a long process to get similar problems that other users are having as well.

## VI. Maintenance

Some maintenance concerns to worry about in the future are the collections in our database. They should be regularly filtered to currently playing titles. A major thing about streaming services is that there is not an infinite amount of time for a specific title to play. They are constantly updating their libraries and we would have to constantly update our database as well. Another maintenance importance is our URL link. If we set up our web app with GitHub pages, there's a chance that our URL might expire and we would have to set up a new one to redirect to the same domain. So keeping up with our web app link would be important as well. 
 
## VII. Future needs

Future versions could include more social networking options that allow you to perhaps connect with other users and see their top recommendations or recent ratings. (Letterboxd would be perfect for this)
