# 4.4. Milestone 3: Usability Testing 25%

Turn in the following either in txt, pdf, doc, or docx:

- [ ] Study Design (grads: comparative study: compare two designs (both must also work with a screen reader)) (8.3 in book)
    - [ ] concerns
    - [ ] purpose
    - [ ] task
    - [ ] scenarios
    - [ ] measurements
    - [ ] test methods
- [ ] Conduct Study with 10 people (Grads: comparative study – 20 people) (8.4, 8.5 in book)
    - [ ] Half of the participants will use the standard GUI interface.
    - [ ] The other half must use the program blindfolded with the screen reader helping them.
- [ ] Analyze Results (turn in excel file) (8.6. in book)
    - [ ] Graphs, mean, range, standard deviation (grads: t-test)
- [ ] Report (1-2 pages, single space, and 11ptArial font) (8.6 in book – ‘Document’ p306-307)
- [ ] Create a video to present your interface and discuss the results of your study. This is mandatory in order to get credit for milestone 3. Presentations must be no longer than 10 minutes. For recording video, I suggest OBS Studio (https://obsproject.com/ )
